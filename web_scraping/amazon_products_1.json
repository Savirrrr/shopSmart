            "The set comes with four different sports balls - a soccer ball, basketball, football, and a classic playground ball. Each ball is perfectly sized for little hands, making them easy to grasp, throw, and kick. The included pump is a great addition, ensuring that the balls stay properly inflated.The quality of these toy sports balls is impressive. They are made from durable materials that can withstand rough play both indoors and outdoors. Despite frequent use, they show no signs of wear and tear, which speaks volumes about their durability. The colors are vibrant and haven't faded, even after being left outside in the sun.Overall, this toy sports ball set is a fantastic investment for any parent looking to provide their kids with a variety of fun and educational activities. The quality, durability, and convenience make it well worth the price. I highly recommend this set for toddlers and young kids who love to play and stay active.\nRead more",
            "Great set of balls for toddlers to play! Material is thick and durable. Comes with a pump and adapters to refill the balls. Small size is great for little hands but big enough for parents to engage in play with their kids. Color and softness is true to actual balls. No funny smells or dyes. Great value for money. My kids love them!\nRead more",
            "All the balls are great for little hands and the green ball was so much fun good size too a little bigger than the tiny balls we received last year. Thoroughly enjoyed. Great durability great grip.\nRead more",
            "Got these for one of the grandkids (almost 2 yrs old).  He loves balls and books so when I saw these it was an easy choice.  They are well made, textured rubber, the included pump is adequate for getting them inflated.  One of his favorite toys!  Def recommend these balls.\nRead more",
            "Smaller sports balls, but will work great for my 1 year old. It is true that the indent stays even after being blown up, but they still roll just fine, which is all that matters for me. The pump not only worked great - I could inflate a ball in about 10 seconds - but it worked with other inflatable balls as well.\nRead more"

            "This was a Christmas gift for my 20-year-old son. I saw that there were cheaper knock-off versions, but since it was a gift, I figured I'd spring for the brand name. It was a hit during our Christmas gathering. 4 generations (from 6 to 75) had fun trying it out, and it didn't take much time for most everyone to become moderately successful at it (the one exception being my husband, bless his heart). Made for a lot of laughs and blackmail videos! We did not use the app. It was a good novelty purchase -- not sure how much use it will get in the future. $30 is a bit much for what you get though. I'm not sure how the quality of the knock-off versions compares to this, but I might advise going for one of them if you're in the market.\nRead more",
            "I bought this for my son, who is a college student! He absolutely loves it! It definitely involves a lot of eye hand coordination! I tried it & wasn\u2019t very successful! He\u2019s great at it! Keeps trying to beat previous score. It\u2019s fun & you are getting some exercise! Great gift!\nRead more",
            "Santa brought this to my son for Christmas this year and it has not disappointed. My son loves it and it gets him doing something other than mundane indoor activities such as television or video games. I also have become quite fond of it and walk around the house with it attached to my head, ready at a moment's notice to engage in some quality fun/hand-eye coordination.It is a simple gadget at a fair price point that provides good entertainment. The competition is also unmatched, getting to see who can get the most consecutive hits. You can gage you're level of progression with the app as well and see how well you match up with others from around the world.In all, I reccomend this product and would definitely purchase again.\nRead more"

            "These balls seem very sturdy, made from thick rubber and can be used by young kids for kick ball, basketball, soccer or whatever they are playing. The bright colors make them easy to find in the yard and the included pump works well.\nRead more",

            "Our kids always seem to loose their balls or they are deflated again. They told me that they wanted to have a Gaga-ball because they knew from school that they can be used for many games. It's a kind of rubbery material which makes it much easier to inflate than for example a soccer ball and not prone to getting holes. Partially drove over one and it's still good, so pretty sturdy / strong. Our daughter was struggling to learn to catch and kept hurting her fingers, so we had one ball not inflated as hard, so she could catch it without bending her fingers. They are fun to use in various games (gaga, four- square, soccer, throw and catch, bouncing / dribbling, basketball), so we now only being one ball when we go camping because it works so good for most sports. The colors are very bright, they are much easier to find in the yard and bushes.\nRead more",
            "GF bought one of those cheap $5 balls from a bin at that large chain dept store for my dog. He took one look, pounced, bit, popped. He was SO SAD! He made us sad. We were all sad. Tried a couple more times with the same results, much sadness for everyone.I remembered back in the olden days (when kids were allowed to play dangerous competitive games like kickball without fear of massive physical or emotional trauma [?!] ), that the tough rubbery material of a kickball - oh, sorry, kicking incites violence, I meant a lower extremity powered dynamic elasticity sphere with high velocity potential and excellent rebounding capacity - may be tough enough for my dog to play with without popping in under a minute.SUCCESS!!! I bought two sets, 8 balls so that if they didn't last long, at least he'd have fun with them for a little while, I inflated them all, put them in a big box, got him all excited (he knows when I buy stuff for him that there's gonna be something awesome inside), and dumped the whole box on his head! Oh The Chaos! The Pandemonium! Many, many happinesses were had by all!Ok, the other reviews are correct, these balls may or may not be the EXACT size described, if for some reason you need a ball that is that level is precisely 8.5 inches, this is not the ball for you. In fact, even individually the balls are different sizes, the red and blue seem to be about 1-2 inches smaller that the green and yellow.However, if you want a couple toys to play with, these are made of the same tough, very elastic material as in the olden days of yore.My dog loves them. I deflated six and put them away, of the two remainders I pulled some air out of one so he could get it in his mouth enough to carry, the other I left firm to torture him with (makes him crazy that he can't pick it up).All in all, a great purchase at a great price. Tried both pumps and all 4 needles. Everything worked perfectly, and he hasn't popped one yet!\nRead more",
            "Balls are a lot smaller than the playground balls we ordered at school that are suppose to be the same size.  Disappointed.Edit: The company did work with me to resolve the issue.  The balls are a heavy duty rubber with a grip pattern.  The diameter is between 7 - 7.5\" and the balls when inflated are fairly hard.  They would be great for Four Square, but I would question using for dodge ball, unless you want to have kids crying.  I feel the balls will hold up to general use.  I appreciate the company making good on this purchase.\nRead more"
